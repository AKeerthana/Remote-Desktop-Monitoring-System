# Remote-Desktop-Monitoring-System
A Network based project developed in Java to provide a mechanism by which the (Server) administrator can access and interact with multiple clients. The main advantage of this software is that the server is provided with all the privileges to monitor any of the client systems that are connected to it.

About the project
In this project initially the HOST (Server) Name should be changed in clients system to which it should be connected.
Firstly the A_Chat_Server.java class should be executed and the server should begin.
Only after the server is connected the A_Chat_client_GUI class should be executed and the client should get connected to server by using any username and a default password "client".
Now both the server and client are in a network and the server can remotely access / monitor the clients system.
The server Inorder access the clients system for the actions like screen control, screenshot, file transfer , shut down has to select the action he wants to perform on the clients screen and has to enter the user name of the client registered.
